    "### Problem 1 - Chicago Crime Dataset (50 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the Chicago Crime Data that was used in HW3. In this HW you are provided with 3 data files namely `chicago_crime_data_1.csv`, `chicago_crime_data_2.csv` and `primary_type_id.csv`.  The `chicago_crime_data_1.csv` contains data pertaining to the details of the crime and the `chicago_crime_data_2.csv` has information about the location and type. Both the datasets have the Crime ID as the primary indicator. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `primary_type_id.csv` contains the mapping between the primary crime type to their corresponding ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing data\n",
    "From the command line, execute the following command (assuming your current directory contains the homework files):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mysql --local-infile -u root -proot < setupdb.sql\n",
    "```\n",
    "> _Note_: In some systems you might not need the `--local-infile` option, it depends on the mode in which the database server is running. If you are running it in default mode, you most likely will need that option\n",
    "\n",
    "The database is needed to verify that your queries are running correctly. But you do not have to submit the output of your queries. You only have to submit the queries and in some cases, the algebraic expression and the expression trees.\n",

    "You will be asked to create a single sql query that will result in the desired output. Wherever required, provide the algebraic expressions and expression trees.\n",
